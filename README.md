# Artium
Artium is a real-time collaboration open-source design full stack web app.

With the help of this tool, you and your team (or friends) may design anything you want at the same time.  As we all know, design tools can be challenging to use due to several integrations, managing complexity and difficulty (what the heck does that even mean? ), and other issues. By providing basic tools and the most popular integrations that your design needs, we aim to eliminate all the frustrations of a simple designer (like myself).
